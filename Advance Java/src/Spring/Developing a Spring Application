Spring Framework
----------------
            Spring Framework is used to develop robust web and enterprise application very easily
            and rapidly

 dependency Injection
 --------------------
            Spring is mostly identified with dependency injection which is flavor of inversion of control (IOC)

            Ex:
                        class Employee
                        {}
                        class Department
                        {
                            Employee emp =new Employee();
                        }
                        Department dept= new Department():

                        In the above code emp object and dept object are tightly coupled

            Ex:
                        class  Employee
                        {}
                        class Department
                        {
                            Employee emp; //property
                            Department(Employee amp) // constructor injection
                            {
                                this.emp=emp;
                            }
                            void setEmp(Employee emp) //setter injection
                           {
                                this.emp=emp;
                           }
                        }
                        Employee emp = new Employee();
                        Department dept= new Department(emp);
                                    ^                     |
                                    |                     |
                                    --------<-------<-------
                                    dependency Injection (lose coupled Application)

 Life cycle of an Object
-------------------------
                    Object Creation -> Object Usage -> Object Destruction\
