Lambda Expressions
----------------------
            - The Expression through which we can represent an anonymous method
            - Anonymous method which does not have any name

syntax
-------
        Parameter       Expression      body
            ()              ->          SOP("Lambda);

Function Interface
        - The Interface which contains only one abstract method but can have multiple
            default and static methods is called as function interface
        - @FunctionalInterface annotation is used to mark an interface as function interface

                Example:
                        - Runnable -> run()
                        - comparable -> compareTo()
                        - Comparator -> compare()

                Refer Program LambdaDemo.java

Java Stream API
-------------------
        - Java Stream API is used to operate on the source data structure(collection/ array)
            and product pipelined data that we can use to perform specific operations like
            we can create a Stream from the list and filter it based on the given condition
         - Java Stream API is used to increase the performance of application
         - Java Stream API is present in java.util.stream package

          Refer Program StreamapiDemo.java

Filtering using stream API
----------------------------
         - filter() is an intermediate operation that reads the data from a stream and
           returns a new stream after transforming the data based on the given conditions

           Refer program StreamDemo2.java
