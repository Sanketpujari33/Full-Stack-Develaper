IO Package
------------
            - IO stand for input output
            - IO package is used for the following
                        - Creating new data files
                        - Writing data onto the data file
                        - opening existing data files
                        - reading data from the data file
                        - closing the file

Stream
-------
        flow of data is called as stream

     Type of Stream
     ---------------
                      - bytes streams
                      - char streams

     - The Top most two abstract classes under byte stream are
        - InputStream
        - OutputStream

     - The top most two abstract classes under char stream are
        - Reader
        - Writer

 Subclasses under InputStream
 -----------------------------
                -FileInputStream
                            - to open existing file and read data from the file

                - BufferedInputStream
                            - To increase the performance of read operations

                - DataInputStream
                            - To read different type of data like int, float, double, String etc.,
                                from the data file

                - ObjectInputStream
                            - To read an object from the data file

                         Refer programs
                                - FileInputStreamDemo.java
                                - DataInputStreamDemo.java

Subclasses under OutputStream
------------------------------
                - FileOutputStream
                            - To create a new file and write data onto the file

                - BufferedOutputStream
                            - To increase performance of write operations

                - DataOutputStream
                            - To write different type of data like int, float, double, String etc.,
                               from the data file

                - ObjectOutputStream
                             - To write an object from the data file

                        Refer programs
                                - FileOutputStreamDemo.java
                                - DataOutputStreamDemo.java

  Note
  -----
       - When we use DataOutputStream to write data onto the file then we need to use DataInputStream to
         read the data from the file

  Subclasses under Reader
  -------------------------
                - FileReader
                            - To open existing file and read the data from the file

                - BufferedReader
                            - To increase the performance of read operations

                        Refer programs
                                - FileReaderDemo.java

  Subclasses under Writer
  -------------------------
                - FileWriter
                        - To create a new file and write the data onto the file

                - BufferedWriter
                         - To increase the performance of write operations


                         Refer programs
                                    - FileWriterDemo.java

Serialization
---------------
         - The process of writing objects onto the data file in called as serialization
         - The process of reading objects from the data file in called as deserialization
         - objectOutputStream class is used to write an object onto the data file using the writeObject();
         - ObjectInputStream class is used to read an object from the data file using the readObject();
         - In order to serialize an object of a class, the class should implement Serialization
            Interface else it will throw "NotSerializableException"
         - Serializable interface is a Marker interface
         - Marker interfaces does not contain any methods

            Refer programs SerializationDemo.java
