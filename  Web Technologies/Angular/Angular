   Angular Framework
-----------------------
                - Angular is a typescript based open source front end web application platform
                - TypeScript is a superScript of javascript

                Javascript vs typeScript
               -----------------------------
                 - JavaScript does not support Data types where as in TypeScript support data types;

                            Example:
                                    JavaScript
                                   ------------
                                        var n=10; //n is number data type
                                        var name = "Sanket"; // name is string data type
                                        var flag = true; // flag is boolean data type

                                   TypeScript
                                  ------------
                                         n : number = 10;
                                         name : string = "Sanket"
                                         flag : boolean = true;

                 - JavaScript is object environment (predefined Object) scripting programming language
                    where as TypeScript is object Oriented (user define classes and objects) programming language

                 - Angular is developed by Google
                 - It is a complete rewrite from the same team that built Angular JS
                        Note: Angular and Angular js are Different
                 - It is used to design Single Page Applications (SPA) using Routing

Angular Setup
--------------
        - Node js
                - used to develop and run Angular Application
                To download
                -------------
                uel: nodejs.org

                To Verify Node js
                -------------------
                            Open command prompt/ terminal
                            c:\> node -v
                                        -v -> version
                            c:\>npm -v
                                    npm-> node package manager-> used to install Angular?CLI
                                        - Sublime Text
                                        - Visual Studio code

                                       To download Visual Studio code
                                       ------------------------------
                                            url: https://code.visualstudio.com/download

                - Angular/ CLI
                ----------------
                            - CLI Stand for command Line Interface
                            - Angular/ CLI makes easy to create an application that already works
                            url: https://angular.io/cli

               Installation Angular/ CLI
               --------------------------
                    Open command Line Interface / Terminal
                      C:\>npm install -g @angular/cli
                            -g -> to install globally so that we can work in any folder

                    To install a specific version of Angular/CIL
                    ----------------------------------------------
                        C:\>npm install -g @angular/cli@11.2.2

                    To Verify
                    ---------
                    c:>ng version

               Creating an Angular Project
               ----------------------------
                    Open command prompt or terminal

                    c:\> md Angular
                    c:\> cd Angular
                    C:\>Angular> ng new Angular-Project

               Run Angular Project
               ---------------------
               C:\Angular>cd Angular-Project
               C:\Angular>Angular-Project> ng serve

               After successfully compilation, open browser and type the following url
                http://localhost:4200

                Work flow of Angular Project
                -----------------------------

                Open Angular-Project folder in visual Studio code

                - When a request is made to an Angular Project, the Server loads index.html file
                - In index.html file, using the element <app-root>, it loads app component(app.component.ts)
                - app component is the root component for Angular Project
                - The presentation of app component is done is app.component.html file
                - The styling of app component is done is app.component.css file

                {{}} -> Data Binding -> used to access the value of the variables/properties from the component
                    into HTML file
                    Refer Program
                            - app.component.ts
                            - app.component.html
                            - app.component.css
