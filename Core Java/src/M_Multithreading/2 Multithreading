sleep();
-------
        - When sleep() is invoked on a thread, the current thread will goto block state
            for the given interval of time

                example:
                        Thread.sleep(1000); //1000 milliseconds ->(1 second)

                        Refer program ThreadMethodsDemo2.java

Creating Threads Using Runnable InterFace
------------------------------------------

        - if a class extends another class and to to make this class as thread,
            the class should implement Runnable interface as Java does not
            support multiple inheritance
Example:
    class A
    {}
    class B extends A, Thread {} //error message - does not support multiple inheritance

        class B extends A implements Runnable
        {
                public void run(){..}
        }

     - Ensures that run() is overridden
        Refer programs RunnableDemo.java

Synchronization
-----------------
            Refer diagram Synchronization


            Thread 1                             Thread 2
            ----------------------------------   -----------------------------------
            | Critical Section (Locked)     |   | Critical Section (Locked)       |
            |                               |   |                                 |
            |   // Synchronized code        |   |   // Synchronized code          |
            |   synchronized (lock) {       |   |   synchronized (lock) {         |
            |       // Access shared data   |   |       // Access shared data     |
            |   }                           |   |   }                             |
            |                               |   |                                 |
            | // Outside synchronized code  |   | // Outside synchronized code    |
            ----------------------------------   -----------------------------------

 - When two or more Threads access the some resource then there is a chance of
    getting concurreny problems
 - Synchronization is used for concurreny problems
 - Synchronized Keywords are used for Synchronization
 - Synchronized Keywords are used for Method or block of statements only

    Example:
            synchronized void xxx()
            {
                ...
                ...
            }
            synchronized void yyy()
            {
                ...
                ...
                synchronized(object) // synchronized block
                {
                         ...
                         ...
                }
                ...
                ...

            }
        - In a synchronized context (method/block) only one thread will be running
            which degreades the performance of application

            Refer program SynchronizationDemo.java


 Inter Thread communication
 --------------------------
                Thread1 -> Task -> result -> Thread2
                - it is done using wait(), notify() and notifyAll() methods
                - These method belong to object class
                - When wait() is invoked on thread, the other Threads will goto block state
                    until notified using notify() or notifyAll()
                - if there is only one thread in block state we use notify() else for one or more
                    threads in block state we use notifyAll()
                - These method need to be used in synchronized context only else it will throw
                    "IllegalMonitorStateException"
