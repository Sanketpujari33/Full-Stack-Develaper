sleep();
-------
        - When sleep() is invoked on a thread, the current thread will goto block state
            for the given interval of time

                example:
                        Thread.sleep(1000); //1000 milliseconds ->(1 second)

                        Refer program ThreadMethodsDemo2.java

Creating Threads Using Runnable InterFace
------------------------------------------

        - if a class extends another class and to make this class as thread,
            the class should implement Runnable interface as Java does not
            support multiple inheritance
Example:
    class A
    {}
    class B extends A, Thread {} //error message - does not support multiple inheritance

        class B extends A implements Runnable
        {
                public void run(){..}
        }

     - Ensures that run() is overridden
        Refer programs RunnableDemo.java

Synchronization
-----------------
            Refer diagram Synchronization


            Thread 1                             Thread 2
            ----------------------------------   -----------------------------------
            | Critical Section (Locked)     |   | Critical Section (Locked)       |
            |                               |   |                                 |
            |   // Synchronized code        |   |   // Synchronized code          |
            |   synchronized (lock) {       |   |   synchronized (lock) {         |
            |       // Access shared data   |   |       // Access shared data     |
            |   }                           |   |   }                             |
            |                               |   |                                 |
            | // Outside synchronized code  |   | // Outside synchronized code    |

     ex:

                  X
                     \
                      \
  Joint account          5000
                      /
                     /
                  Y

            t1 - X checks balance - 5000
            t2 - X withdraws -1000
            t3 - Y checks balance - 4000
            t4 - Y withdraws - 1000
            ...
            ...
            t12 - X checks balance - 1000
            t13 - Y checks balance - 1000
            t14 - X withdraw - 1000
            t15 - Y withdraws - insufficient balance (concurrency problem)


    X
      \
       \
        \
Synchronized void makeWithdrawal(int amt)
        /     {
       /         // check balance
      /           ...
    Y             ...
                 // withdraw
                 ...
                 ...
                 }


 - When two or more Threads access the some resource then there is a chance of
    getting concurrency problems
 - Synchronization is used for concurrency problems
 - Synchronized Keywords are used for Synchronization
 - Synchronized Keywords are used for Method or block of statements only

    Example:
            synchronized void xxx()
            {
                ...
                ...
            }
            synchronized void yyy()
            {
                ...
                ...
                synchronized(object) // synchronized block
                {
                         ...
                         ...
                }
                ...
                ...

            }
        - In a synchronized context (method/block) only one thread will be running
            which degrades the performance of application

            Refer program SynchronizationDemo.java


 Inter Thread communication
 --------------------------

                Thread1 -> Task -> result -> Thread2

                - it is done using wait(), notify() and notifyAll() methods
                - These method belong to object class
                - When wait() is invoked on thread, the other Threads will goto block state
                    until notified using notify() or notifyAll()
                - if there is only one thread in block state we use notify() else for one or more
                    threads in block state we use notifyAll()
                - These method need to be used in synchronized context only else it will throw
                    "IllegalMonitorStateException"

                    Refer program InterThreadDemo.java
