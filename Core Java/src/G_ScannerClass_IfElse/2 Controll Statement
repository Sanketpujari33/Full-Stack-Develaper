                    statements-2;
                    ...
                    statements-n;

           using {} is optional

           Example:
                    int n1 = 10;
                    int n2 = 5;
                     if(n1 > n2)
                      SOP("Big = "+n1);
                     else
                       SOP("Big = "+n2);
                    Output
                    --------
                    Big = 10;

           Example:
                    int n1 = 10;
                    int n2 = 15;
                     if(n1 > n2)
                      SOP("Big = "+n1);
                     else
                      SOP("Big = "+n2);
                    Output
                    --------
                    Big = 15;

        {
            statements;

        {
            statements;

2.WAP to check the whether the given number is positive or negative or zero
        Refer program CheckNumber.java

    n1, n2, n3
    Refer program BigThree.java

 4. WAP to find area of a circle
        double PI = 3.14;
        area = PI * radius * radius;
      Refer program CircleAreaCalculator.java

 5. WAP to check whether the given age is major or minor
        Note: if the given age is < 0 than display "Invalid age"
        Refer program AgeChecker.java

 7. WAP to accept item number, item name, rate and quantity, find price (rate * qty)
    Calculate discount as follows
            if(price >= 1000 and <2000)
            discount is 10% on price
            if(price >= 2000 and < 3000)
            discount is 15% on price
            if(price >= 3000 and < 5000)
             discount is 20% on price
             if(price >= 5000)

            program
            --------
                if(price >=1000 && <2000)
                 discount = o.10 * price

                Refer program ItemPricing.java
