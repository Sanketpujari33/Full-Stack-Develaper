                    st-2;
                    ...

    Example:
            1 2 3 ... 9 10
             int i = 1;
               while(i<=10)
               {
                 SOP(i);
                 i++;
               }
    1. WAP to display even number feom 1 to 100
     output
     ------
      2 4 6 8 ... 98 100
      Refer program Even.java
    2. WAP to find sum of given 10 numbers
        int sum = 0;
            sum = sum + n;
            Refer program SumTen.java

    3. WAP to find biggest of given 10 numbers
        n>big
        big =n;
        Refer program BigTen.java

    4.WAP to check whether the given char is vowel or consonant (Switch)
            Refer program VowelConsonantChecker.java

    5. WAP to find sum of even numbers and sum of odd numbers from 1 to 100
         Refer program EvenOddSum.java
         int sumEven=0; int sumOdd=100;

    6. WAP to find smallest of given 10 numbers
        Refer program SmallestNumberFinder.java

    7.WAP to find sum of digits of a given number
        n=1234 (1+2+3+4 =10)
        Refer program SumOfDigits.java
