                do
                {
                    st-1;
                    st-2;
                    ...
                    st-n;
                }
             while (condition)
              Note: if no {} then it considers only one stargument

        In case of while loop the condition  is checked before the statements where as
            in case of do...while loop the condition is checked after the statements

         Example:
            1 2 3 ... 9 10
            int i = 1;
            do{
                SOP(i);
                i++;
                }
                while(i<=10);

               WAP to accept the current balance and display the following options/ menu
                        1. Deposit
                        2. Withdraw
                        3. Display Balance
                        4. Exit

                    The menu shold display repeatedly until the user chooses Exit
                    Refer Program Bank.java

                If the value of condition is accepted in the loop statements then it is suggested
                to use do..while loop
