## Java Introductions

       - Java is an object oriented programming language developed by the James Gosling
         at the Sun Microsystems
       - The Sun Microsystems is acquired by the Oracle Corporation in 2010

Object Oriented Concepts / Feature

---

        - Object
        - Classes
        - Abstraction
        - Encapsulation
        - Inheritance
        - Polymorphism

Object

---

    An object is a real time entity which has identity, state and behavior
    refer digram

                              Object
                                |

## Class

A class is a Collection of data members and Methods

Example
class Person
{
//Data members
int age;
String name;
float age;
//Methods
eat(){---};
walk(){---};
}
age=20; error
The members (data members/methods) of thr class are accessed using objects
with dot(.) operator

creating objects

---

syntax

---

className objName= new ClassName();

Example
Person person= new Person(); //person is an object of class Person
p.age =20;
p.name="Ram";
p.height=5.9;
p.walk();
p.eat();
