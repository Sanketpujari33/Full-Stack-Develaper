---------------
  Static keyword
 --------------
        - Static keyword can be used for data members, methods and inner classes (a class within a class)
        - Static Keyword can be used for top level class (outer classes)

        Example:
                static class MyClass{}; // error message

        -static keyword cannot be used for local variables (declared within a method)

        Example:
                class MyClass
                {
                    void xxx()
                    {
                       static int n;//error- local variable n cannot be static
                    }

                }
        - Static members are accessible directly with the class without creating objects
        - object can also access static members
        - A static method can access only other static members directly
        - A static variable acts as a global variable within class means all objects
            of the class can access static variable memory

            Refer program StaticDemo.java

Package
---------
        - A package is a collection of related classes (.class files)
        - A package keyword is used to create a package
        Example:
                package mypack;

        - Package statement should be the first statement in source code file
        Example:
                X.java
                ------
                        package mypack;
                        import ....;
                        import ....;
                        class A{};
                        class B{};
        - In a source code file, We can have only one package statement with multiple
            import and class declaration
        - The class under the package are stored in a folder whose name is same as the
            package name
        - only public classes are accessible outside of the package
        - To use the classes of one package into another we need to import the package
            Example:
                    import mypack.A;
                    import mypack.B;
                            or
                    import mypack.*;//* indicates all classes under the package

   Example Application:
   ---------------------
                - Create  a package "mypack2" in myProject
                    Right-click on the myProject -> new -> package

                        Name: mypack2
                        and then click finish
                - Create a class "CalculatorTest" in mypack2 package
                       Right-click on the mypack2 -> new -> class

                      Name: CalculatorTest
                      make check mark to main()
                      and then click finish
                      Refer program CalculatorTest.java (Run)

                 package com.oop.program;
                        creates s folder "com" with a sub-folder "oop" and with a sub-folder "program"
                        under "oop" folder
                        - com
                            - oop
                                - program
                                \
           import java.util.Scanner;
                Scanner is .class file present in "util" folder which is sub-folder of "java" folder
