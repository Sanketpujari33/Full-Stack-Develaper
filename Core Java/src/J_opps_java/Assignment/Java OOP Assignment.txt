Java OPP Assignment
--------------------

        1. Write a program which creates a class "Student" with the following
            Data Members
            -------------
                rollNum, studName, mark1, mark2, mark3, totalMarks

            Methods
            -------
              setStudDetails() - which sets the values to all the data members except totalMarks.
              calculate Total() which calculate the total Marks
              displayStudDetails() - which displays rollNum, studName and totalMarks
              Create a class StudentDemo to test the functionality of Student class



        2. Create a class Account with the attributes accountNo - int, account Type - String,
           accountBalance - int and methods setAccountDetails() which set the values to these
           attributes, withdraw() which subtracts the given amount from the available balance,
           deposit() which adds given amount to the available balance and dispAccountDetails()
           which displays accountNo, accountType, accountBalance. Create a class Main1 which
           contains main() method to test the functionality of Account class.


        3. Convert the above two programs using constructors.


        4. Write a program to create a class Rectangle with datamembers length and breadth.
           Create a method area() which finds the area of the rectangle. Use constructors to assign
           values to datamembers

        5. Create a class Customer with the fields custld, custName and custAddress. Create a
           method display() which displays the Customer details.
           Create a class Account with the fields acctld, acctType, Customer and acctBalance.
           Create a method display() which displays Account Details
           Create a main class "AccountTest" to test the above classes
           Note: Use constructors to set the values to the fields of the classes

        6. Write a program to find the number of instances created for a given class.


        7. Create a class Book with the data members bno, bname, price.
           Create a class SpecialEditionBook which is subclass of Book and with a data member
           discount. Create a class Book Test with main() to test the above classes
           Note:
           ----
            - Use constructors to give the values to the data members
            - create a method display() in Book class which displays bno, bname and price
              and override the same display() of Book class in SpecialEdition Book which displays
              bno, bname, price using super.display() and display the value of discount.


        8. Create an abstract class "Fruit" which contains an abstract method cost().
           Create sub classes "Apple and Mango" which extends Fruit class. Use appropriate data
           members in the respective classes. Create a class FruitDemo to test the above
           functionalities.(abstract class)


        9. Modify the above program using interfaces(Interfaces)

        10. Create a package "com.account".
            Create a class "Account" with the fields acctld, acctType, acctBalance. Use Constructor
            to set the values to these fields. Create the following methods in the Account class
                void deposit(int amount)
                void withdraw(int amount)
                int getBalance()
                void display()
            Create a package "com account test"
