  Java OOP
 -----------
        -OOP stand for Object Orianted Programming

 class
 ------
    - A class is a collection of data members and methods

    Example:
    --------
             class Employee
             {
                //Data members
                    int empNum;
                    String empName;
                    double empSalary;

                 //Method
                    void setEmpDetails()
                    {
                        ...
                    }
                    void dispEmpDetails()
                    {
                        ...
                    }
             }
      empNum = 111; //error

Object
-------
       - An instance of class is called as object

Creating object
----------------
        syntax
        --------
                    ClassName objName = new className();

        Example:
        --------
                Employee e= new Employee();// e is an object of class Employee

                - The member (data member/Method) of the class are accessed using objects with dot(.) operator

        Example:
        --------
                e.empNum = 111;
                e.empName = "Sanket"
                e.setEmpDetails();

        - When a new object is created for class then it allocates a new memory for
          all data members of the class and values in data members are default values

        - Default Values
        -----------------
                    byte, short, int, long --> 0
                    float, double --> 0.0
                    char --> ''
                    boolean --> false
                    Reference type (String) --> null

        - This reference
        ---------------------
                    - This refer to the current object
                    - This reference is generally used to differentiate data members of a class and
                        arguments of a method when the names are same

                     Refer program EmployeeTest.java

        Constructors
        --------------
                - A constructor is a special method whose name is same as the class name
                    used to initialize the object and does not return anything not even void

                      Example:
                                   class Sample
                                   {
                                          int i;
                                          int j;
                                          Sample();// constructor
                                          {
                                            i=10;
                                            j=20;
                                          }
                                          void Sample{};//not a constructor, an ordinary method
                                   }
                                   Sample n=new Sample();// constructor
                                    SOP(s.i+" "+ s.j);//10 20
                                    Refer program ConstructorDemo1.java

        Point on Constructors
        ------------------------
                        - If a class does not contain a constructor, java create a
                               default constructor(no arguments constructor)

                        Example:
                            class Sample
                            {
                                Sample(){}; //default constructor,add implicitly
                            }

                        - If a class contains parameterized constructor, then it is the responsibility
                            of the programmer to create default constructor in the class

                         Refer program ConstructorDemo2.java
