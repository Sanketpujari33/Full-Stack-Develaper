  Inheritance
 --------------
            - The process of creating new classes from the existing classes is called as inheritance
            - In Java, extends keywords is used to create new class from the existing class
                Example:
                        class Vehicle // Base class or Super class or Parent class
                        {
                            ...
                            ...
                        }
                        class Car extends Vehicle // Derived class or sub class or child class
                        {
                             ...
                             ...
                        }
            - Through inheritance we can achieve reusalility of the code
            - Java does not support multiple inheritance due to ambiguities means in java a class
                can extend only one class

                Example:
                    class A
                    {}
                    class B
                    class C extends A, B{}// error -does not support multiple inheritance

                Example:
                 Vehicle (Car, Bike, Bus)
                 Furniture (Chair, Table)
                 Fruit (Apple, Mango)
                 Account (Saving Account, Current Account)

            - Inheritance is "is-a"  relationship

            has-a relationship
            ------------------

                Example:
                        class Employee{};
                        claas Department extends Employee{};// not good initialisation

                        class Department //Department has Employee
                        {
                                Employee emp;                        // good initialisation
                        };

                        Refer program InheritanceDemo1.java


 Polymorphism
 ---------------
            - Polymorphism means many forms
             Types
             ------
                    - Compile time Polymorphism
                        - Method Overloading

                    - Run time Polymorphism
                         - Method Overriding

             Methods Overloading
             --------------------
                   - Method name is same but the signature is different
                          signatures-->number of arguments/type of arguments

                               Example:
                                        area(int , int, int){}
                                        area(int , int){}
                                        area(float, float){}

                    -Applicable within the same class as well as subclasses

              Method overriding
              -----------------
                        - Method name is same and signature is also same
                        - Applicable only in sub-class

                                Example:
                                        class Vehicle
                                        {
                                                void drive(){...}
                                        }
                                        class Car extends Vehicle
                                        {
                                                void drive(int speed){...}//overload method
                                                void drive(){...}//overriding method
                                        }
                                        Car c =new Car();
                                        c.drive();// invoke drive() of car

                        - If a subclass object invoke the overridden method then it will invoke the
                            method present in subclass



             Super Reference
             ----------------
                            Super reference is used to refer to the Base class member from Derived class Method
