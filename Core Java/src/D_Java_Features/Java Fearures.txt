Java Features
--------------
    1- Simple
        - Java is simple as it contains most's of APIs (Application Programming Interface)/ Libraries
        - Example:- Arrays.sort(N)

    2- object Oriented
        - Java is object-oriented (OO) as it supports all OO features like
            objects, classes, abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance and Polymorphism

    3- Robust
            - Robust means strong
            - In java we can develop robust applications using Exception Handling
              which avoids abnormal termination of the application

    4- platform Independent
            - Refer Diagram platform independent

                                                     Platform Independent

         |                                                   |                                                     |
         |- A java program can run on any platform (OS);     |                                                     |
         |- A java program is Write Once Run anywhere (WORA) |                                                     |
         |- A java program is a Collections of classes       |                                                     |
         |                                                   |                                                     |
         | Example:-                                         | To Compile                                          |
         |       X.java(Source Code)                         | >java x.java                                        |
         |                                                   |   - creates A.class, B.class and C.class            |
         |       Class A                                     |   - these class files are called as Byte code       |
         |       {                                           |   - these Byte Codes are Platform Independent      |
         |        Void main(){...}                           |- To run a java program at least one class should    |
         |       }                                           |  contain main Method                                |
         |       class B                                     |- main() is the entry point to run a java program.   |
         |       {                                           |- We can run only .class files which contains main() |
         |         Void main(){...}                          |To Run                                               |
         |       }                                           |> Java A --> run the program from A class            |
         |        class C                                    |> JAva B --> runs the program from B class main()    |
         |       {                                           |> Java C --> Error -No main() found                  |
         |                                                   |> java X --> Error -No class definition found        |
         |       }                                           |                                                     |
         |---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

        5- Interpreted
            - Java command is an interpreter
            - java interpreter executes the byte code line by line
            - java command is a compiler
            - java compiler converts java source code into byte code at a time

        6- Portable
            - Java is portable since the size of respective data type is name
                on all platforms

            C/C+
            ----
             - Size of int data type --> 2 bytes on 32-bit/4 bytes on 64-bit OS
             Java
             ----
             - Size of int data type --> 4 bytes on 32-bit/4 bytes on 64-bit OS

        7- Secure
            - java is secure as java does not support as pointers violate security

            C/C++
            ----
            A pointer is a variable which contains address af another variable
            int n=10;
            int *p =&n;// of n variable

        8- Multithreading
            - A thread is a lightweight process under execution within process
            - Multithreading is used to increase the performance of the Application

        9- Dynamic
            - Memory allocation for arrays, objects is done during runtime (Dynamic)
            - java is automatic garbage collections

        10- Distributed
            - Distribute application are used for the purpose of exchanging date
             from one application to another application
