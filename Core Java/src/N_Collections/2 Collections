Methods of List interface
-------------------------
            - boolean add(object) -> add an element at last
            - void add(int,object) -> add an element at thr given index
            - void set(int,object) -> modify/update an element at thr given index
            - boolean remove(object) -> delete the given element
            - object remove(int) -> delete the element at given index
            - object set(int) -> return the element at given index
            - int size() -> return the number of elements

            Refer program ArrayListDemo.java


Additional methods in LinkedList class
---------------------------------------
            - addFrist()
            - addLast()
            - removeFirst()
            - removeLast()

 Traversing and Iterating
  -------------------------
              -  Accessing every element of List/set is called as Traversing

Generics in Collections
-----------------------
              - Generics are added in java 5 version
              - Generics are used to different data type
              - When Generics are used in collections we can ensure that only similar type of
                elements are present in the collection
              - When Generics are used in collections we can traverse that element using
                Enhanced for loop (foreach)

                Refer program GenericsCollection.java
Set Interface
---------------
        - Set is unordered collection of elements
        - Set does not allow duplicate elements

Classes under Set interface
----------------------------
        - HashSet - unordered and no duplicate elements
        - LinkedHashSet - ordered and no duplicate elements
        - TreeSet - sorted and no duplicate elements

        Refer program SetDemo.java

WAP to remove duplicate moblie number from the given list of moblie numbers
        Refer program RemoveDuplicate.java



Map interFace
--------------
            - Map is used to collect tje elements in the form of key-value pairs
            - map does not allow duplicate keys

Class under Msp Interface
--------------------------
            - HashMap --> unordered based on keys and no duplicate keys
            - LinkedHashMap --> ordered based on keys and no duplicate keys
            - TreeMap --> sorted based on keys and no duplicate keys

       Refer program MapDemo.java

 Traversing and Iterating Map
  ---------------------------
            - Get the keys of Map into a set
              Example:
                    HashMap<String, Integer> hm = new HashMap<String, Integer>();
                    Set<String> keys =hm.keySet();
            - Iterate the keys present in set
                 for(String key : keys)
                 SOP(key+":"+ hm.grt(key));

                 - hm.get(key) -> return the value of the given key

                 Refer program IterateMapDemo.java

   WAP to do the following LinkedList operations

    1. Add element at last
    2. Add element at first
    3. Add element at the given index
    4. Update element at the given index
    5. Delete the first element
    6. Delete the last element
    7. Delete the given element
    8. Delete the element at given index
    9. Display the elements
    10. Exit

        - The menu should display repeatedly until the user chooses Exit
        - The element value and index need to be accepted during runtime using Scanner class
                Refer program LinkedListOperations.java
