Collections
----------------
        Collections are used to collect the elements of variables size (not fixed)

 Arrays vs Collections
 ----------------------
                - In Array we can collect the elements of fixed size where as in collections
                    we can collect the elements of Variable size (not fixed)
                - In Array we can collect only similar  type of elements where as in collections
                    we can collect different type of elements
                - In Arrays we can collect primitive type as well as reference type of elements
                    where as in collections we can collect only reference type of elements

Collection vr MAP
------------------
              - Collection is used to collect the elements where as map is used to collect
                elements in the from of key-value`
               Ex:
                collection -> ["apple", "orange", "mango"]

                MAp -> {"eno": 111, "ename":"Sanket", "salary":8000.0}

List vs Set
    -List is ordered where as set is unordered
    - List allow duplicate elements where as set does not allow duplicate elements

    Example:
        elements -> 5,8,6,4,7
        ordered ->  5,8,6,4,7
        unOrdered -> 7,4,6,8,5
        sorted  -> 4,5,6,7,8 /8,7,6,5,4

ArrayList vs LinkedList
-------------------------
        - In ArrayList the elements are stored in continuous memory locations where as
          in Linklist the elements are stored in non-continuous memory locations in the
          from of nodes (A node is divided into two parts: element values and link to the next node)
        - In case of ArrayList, the cost of insert and delete operations are more where as
          in case of Linklist, the code of insert and delete operations are less
        - ArrayList occupies less memory than Linklist

HashSet
--------
        - Hashset is unordered and no duplicate elements

LinkedHashSet
-------------
        - LinkedHashSet is ordered and no duplicate elements

TreeSet
-------
        TreeSet is sorted and no duplicate elements

 HashMap
 --------
        HashMap is unordered based on keys and no duplicate Keys

LinksHashMap
---------------
            LinksHashMap is ordered based on keys and no duplicate Keys

TreeMap
----------
        TreeMap is sorted based on keys and no duplicate Keys
