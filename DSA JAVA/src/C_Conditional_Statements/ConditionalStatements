Conditional Statements ‘if-else’
            - The if block is used to specify the code to be executed if the condition
              specified  in if is true, the else block is executed otherwise.

int age = 30;
if(age > 18) {
   System.out.println("This is an adult");
} else {
   System.out.println("This is not an adult");
}

Conditional Statements ‘switch’
            - Switch case statements are a substitute for long if statements that compare
              a variable to multiple values. After a match is found, it executes the
              corresponding code of that value case.

        The following example is to print days of the week:

int n = 1;
switch(n) {
   case 1 :
       System.out.println("Monday");
       break;
   case 2 :
       System.out.println("Tuesday");
       break;
   case 3 :
       System.out.println("Wednesday");
       break;
   case 4 :
       System.out.println("Thursday");
       break;
   case 5:
       System.out.println("Friday");
       break;
   case 6 :
       System.out.println("Saturday");
       break;
   default :
       System.out.println("Sunday");
}



Homework Problems
1. Make a Calculator. Take 2 numbers (a & b) from the user and an operation as follows :
	1 : + (Addition) a + b
    2 : - (Subtraction) a - b
    3 : * (Multiplication) a * b
    4 : / (Division) a / b
    5 : % (Modulo or remainder) a % b
    Calculate the result according to the operation given and display it to the user.

2. Ask the user to enter the number of the month & print the name of the month.
   For eg - For ‘1’ print ‘January’, ‘2’ print ‘February’ & so on.

4. Enter 3 numbers from the user & make a function to print their average.

5. Write a function to print the sum of all odd numbers from 1 to n.

6. Write a function which takes in 2 numbers and returns the greater of those two.

7. Write a function that takes in the radius as input and returns the circumference
    of a circle.

9. Write a function that takes in age as input and returns if that person is eligible to
    vote or not. A person of age > 18 is eligible to vote.

10.Write an infinite loop using do while condition.

11. Write a program to enter the numbers till the user wants and at the end it should
    display the count of positive, negative and zeros entered.

12. Two numbers are entered by the user, x and n. Write a function
    to find the value of one number raised to the power of another i.e. xn.

13. Write a function that calculates the Greatest Common Divisor of 2 numbers.

14. Write a program to print Fibonacci series of n terms where n is input by user :
     0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 .....

16. In the Fibonacci series, a number is the sum of the previous 2 numbers that
    came before it.
