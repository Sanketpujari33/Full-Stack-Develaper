XML
-----
     - XML stands for Extensible Markup Language
     - XML is used to transport the data from one application to another application
     - In Java, XML is used to create configuration files required for for the application

HTML Vs XML
---------------
            - In HTML, all tags are predefined tags where as in XML all tags are used defined tags
            - HTML is used to present the data where as XML is for data about data (META_DATA)
                Example:
                            <b>50000</b> -> HTML -> 5000 is presented as bold
                            <salary>50000</salary> -> XML -> 5000 is salary
            - HTML is not case sensitive where as XML is case sensitive
                    <salary>50000</Salary> -> XML -> ERROR
            - HTM is not standard where XML is standard

Valid XML
------------
        - A XML file should contain only one root tag (the first tag in XML  file is root tag)
        - For every tags there should be a closing tag or self enclosing tag
            Example
                    <mytag>mytag</mytag>
                    <mytag/> -> self enclosing tag

        - Attribute values should be in either " " or ''
        Example:
                <property name="salary" value="5000"/>

        - No overlapping of tags
            Example:
                    <employee><salary>500</employee></salary> -> error -> overlapping tags
