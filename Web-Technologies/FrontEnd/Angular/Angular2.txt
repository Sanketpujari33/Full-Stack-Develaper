Angular Directives
---------------------
    *ngFor and *ngIf are angular directives

    Example:
    ---------
            - Create a new component "address"
             >ng generate component address

             Refer program
                    - address.component.ts
                    - address.component.html
                    - address.component.css
                    - address.component.html (update)

Angular Forms
-------------
            - Angular Forms are used to accept the user input and submit the form data to the
                component
            - To use Angular Forms we need to add "FormsModule" into app.module.ts file
                    Refer program app.module.ts

            Example Application
            --------------------
                        - Create a new component "book"
                            >ng generate component book
                                        or
                            >ng g c book (shortcut)

                            Refer program
                                    - book.component.ts
                                    - book.component.html
                                    - book.component.html (Updated)

                        [(ngModule)] -> two way date binding
